	      			Different from the traditional international education agency who make profit by providing studying abroad related information, <span className="highlight-newyear">Palmdrive shares it for free</span>. With the belief of helping more Chinese students study abroad, Palmdrive operates a platform for students who want to study abroad with who studied abroad or is studying abroad.
	      		</p>
	      		<p>
							In order to be known by the market, branding events were launched <span className="highlight-newyear">fast and massively</span>. In this case, events for different marketing preferences were developed.
	      		</p>
	      		<p>
							New Year Event was the first city event to offer an opportunity for Palmdrive to <span className="highlight-newyear">communicate with college students and add their belief to our brand</span>.
	      		</p>
		        <div className="section-sub-title"> My Role </div>
	      		<p>
	      			I collaborated with Su, the event executor, since the start of the project. I delivered <span className="highlight-newyear">digital posters, website, and invitation email</span> for different platforms in 2 weeks.

	      		With limit budget and time, we decided to cut off the printing part and promote the event only on digital platforms which would reduce the budget by 30% and preparation time by 50%.
	      		</p>
	      		<p>
						Moreover, it was easy for our targets to <span className="highlight-newyear">repost, @ their friends and interact</span> with us on social media platforms, like Wechat.
						</p>
	      		<p>
						As the promotion would happen only on digital, I was so excited to start my design with <span className="highlight-newyear">no worries about the CMYK and print quality</span>. First time I could use some <span className="highlight-newyear">real bold colors</span>!
						</p>
	      		<p>
						To be more festive, colorful confetti was added and I finished the key visual in <span className="highlight-newyear">4 hours</span>.

		        </p>
		        <p>
							On Weibo and Wechat Moment, we used 9 images with questions to interact with our followers. <span className="highlight-newyear">9-image-display</span> forms a whole picture, leading to big visual impact.

		        <p>
		        	After that, we posted image with little poems to express our thanks and sincere invitation on <span className="highlight-newyear">Wechat Public Account</span>. Our followers extracted the <span className="highlight-newyear">QR code</span> to take the survey and sign up for the event.

		        <p>
		        	To get continuous exposure and a large audience, I also designed <span className="highlight-newyear">Countdown Posters</span> with QR code of the survey.
